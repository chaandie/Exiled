<a href="http://exiled.psim.us" target="_blank">_A server filled with memes, and well a lot of chat commands and metagames._</a>
### Node Version:
This server requires the Node Js Version 6.6.0 or higher<br>
### To start:
#### `Windows`
* On Windows OS you can install a preferred Version of NodeJS easily from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* After installing your preffered version of NodeJS (>6.2), you can easily start up NodeJS Command Prompt then run
``node app`` or ``node app.js`` you even might specify the port in which to run the server on eg:- ``node app.js 8080`` if you do not mention the port, the mentioned port from **Config.port** will be used to run the server
#### `Linux`
* On Linux you need to have NodeJS installed (>6.2) if you do not have it installed simply open the terminal then run
``$ nvm install 6.2`` (6.2 or your prefered version)
* You can easily intall more than one version of NodeJS on your PC/VM with ``nvm install 6.2`` and use that using ``nvm use 6.2``
* Now your terminal is set to use nodejs 6.2 or your prefered version, now you can start up the server by running
``node app`` or ``node app.js`` you even might specify the port in which to run the server on eg:- ``node app.js 8080`` if you do not mention the port, the mentioned port from **Config.port** will be used to run the server
